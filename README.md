# Triangles

What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any?

The biggest challenge I encountered with this assignment was figuring out the syntax for Python. I'm personally used to writing code in Java and using JUnit to write test cases, and an assignment of this size would have taken me maybe 20 minutes to complete. However, with all of the breaks I took to look up Python syntax or figuring out how Python's unittest worked, I spent a lot longer than 20 minutes.


What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?

The requirements spec for this assignment was thorough enough. Any trouble I had with the assignment came from figuring out the problem itself, as opposed to trying to figure out what the actual assignment was asking me to do.


What challenges did you encounter with the tools?

I initially used Pycharm to write out my code, but writing tests there never led to an output in the console for whatever reason. I had to switch to VSCode and re-order my files for the IDE to switch to a testing perspective, and I was ab le to move forward from there.


Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?

I knew that I was done when I wrote test cases to cover the usual issues that previous classes have taught me about. Things like testing negative numbers or 0 are very common in situations where those wouldn't make sense (like sides of a triangle). It was a weird feeling fighting not going back to my code and handling all of the edge cases, but I followed the advice of the assignments spec and intentionally left my code as naive as possible in order to prove myself wrong with the test cases.
